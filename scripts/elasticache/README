This README is for the benefit of those looking at the contents of the work in this spike (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/134681911), not for actual use within any repository.

# Example usage

```
./elasticache.py --provision --vpc-id vpc-c461eaa0 --instance-id h-$(date +%s) --service-id service-1 --plan-id plan-1 --org-id org-1 --space-id space-1 --security-group-id sg-2be5874d --org-name testers --space-name healthcheck
```

You will need to deploy using this branch and manually pull the `elasticache_broker_instances_security_group_id` from the Terraform outputs in the cf-terraform job.
You will also need to supply the ID of your VPC. At the time of writing we did not actually get around to deploying an actual app which uses a Redis instance, so you will need to figure that bit out and supply the necessary space and org.
